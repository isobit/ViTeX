Blocks, sections, titles, etc, call all be added with a simple keystroke!

  * Customizable comment structure characters and widths.
  * Automagic filetype-based commenting.

Installation
------------

Copy plugin/ViTex.vim to your .vim/plugins folder. That's it!

Usage

```
#=== Comment ===========
```
